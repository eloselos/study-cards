# study-cards
Developed a responsive flashcard study app with custom deck/card creation, flip animations, difficulty tagging, and study tracking. Replaced browser prompts with modal forms for better UX, and used localStorage for persistent data. Designed a clean, modern UI using CSS variables and responsive grids.
